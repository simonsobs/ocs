Agents
======

This section starts with a guide for writing an Agent from scratch and is
followed by several reference pages for select features. If you are just
starting out writing an Agent you should read the :ref:`writing_an_agent`
guide. If you have already written an Agent, you might be looking for
information in one of the reference pages.
