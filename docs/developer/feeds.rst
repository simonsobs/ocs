Data Feeds
==========

WAMP applications pass data between components via a publish/subscribe
interface.  A component can publish data to a unique address, and then any
other component can register a callback to monitor said address. Any time data
is published, all subscribed components will receive that data with the
registered callback function.

The OCS Feed is a layer on top of this basic pub/sub functionality that agents
can use to pass data to other OCS agents or clients.  The OCS agent contains
several methods which make it easy to register new feeds, publish data to
registered feeds, and subscribing to other agent's feeds.  The feed system adds
some structure to the base pub/sub layer by adding features such as
data-caching, data and feed-name verification, and aggregation behavior
customization.


Registering Feeds
-----------------

A custom Agent class can register a feed using its ``OCSAgent`` instance. For
example, if the OCSAgent instance is stored in the ``self.agent`` variable, a
basic feed can be registered by calling::

    self.agent.register_feed(feed_name)

The ``register_feed`` function takes a few other key word arguments to customize
its behavior (See :ref:`OCSAgent API <ocs_agent_api>` for more details).
``buffer_time`` will set how long the feed should buffer messages before sending
over crossbar, and ``max_messages`` will set how many messages are cached.

Feed Name Rules
```````````````

Data on this feed will be published to the URI ``<agent_uri>.feeds.<feed_name>``
so feed names must follow standard
`URI formatting rules <https://crossbar.io/docs/URI-Format/>`_, meaning
the feed can only use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
As the ``agent_uri`` will be unique for each agent, feed names are not required
to be globally unique.

For instance, the Lakeshore372 agent may register a feed called ``temperatures``.
A Lakeshore372 instance with instance-id ``LSASIM`` would then publish data to
the URI ``observatory.LSASIM.feeds.temperatures``.

Aggregator Parameters
`````````````````````
If you'd like your feed to be recorded by the hk aggregator, you must register
with the keyword ``record=True``, and you can customize the hk aggregator
behavior with the ``agg_params`` option.
These parameters will be passed to the :ref:`Provider <agg_provider_api>`
constructor, which will unpack them and set defaults.
The following options can be specified here:

.. list-table:: Aggregator params
    :widths: 20 20

    * - frame_length (float)
      - Aggregation time (seconds) before frame is written to disk

    * - fresh_time (float)
      - Time (seconds) before feed is considered "stale", and is removed from
        the HK status frame

    * - exclude_aggregator (bool)
      - If True, the HK Aggregator will not record this feed to G3.

    * - exclude_influx (bool)
      - If True, the InfluxPublisher will not publish feed to the influx
        database.


Publishing to a Feed
--------------------
You can publish data to a feed by calling::

    agent.publish_to_feed(feed_name, message)

For standard feeds, message can be any json-ifyable object (i.e. strings, ints,
floats, bools, or dicts containing these).
Callbacks will receive the tuple ``(message, feed_data)`` where ``feed_data``
is a dict encoding most OCS.Feed attributes.


.. _recorded_feed_registration:

Recorded Feed Registration
````````````````````````````
To make sure that a feed is picked up
by the aggregator, it must be registered with the option 'record=True'.
It also must be registered with the frame_length, which tells the aggregator
how long each frame should be in seconds.
An example can be seen in LS372_agent.py::

    agg_params = {
        'frame_length': 10*60 #[sec]
    }
    self.agent.register_feed('temperatures',
                             record=True,
                             agg_params=agg_params,
                             buffer_time=1)

.. _feed_message_format:

Recorded Feed Message Format
`````````````````````````````
Recorded feeds require data to have a specific structure so that the aggregator
can encode the data into G3 objects.
Each message published should contain a ``block`` of data, or a group of data
that is co-sampled. Messages should have this structure::

    message = {
        'block_name': <Key to identify group of co-sampled data>
        'timestamp': <ctime of data>
        'data': {
            'field_name_1': <datapoint1>,
            'field_name_2': <datapoint2>
        }
    }

or if data is buffered on the agent-side, multiple co-sampled data points can
be passed at once as::

    message = {
        'block_name': <Key to identify group of co-sampled data>
        'timestamps': [ctime1, ctime2, ... ]
        'data': {
            'field_name_1': [data1_1, data1_2, ...],
            'field_name_2': [data2_1, data2_2, ...]
        }
    }

Note the pluralized ``timestamps`` key.

Data with consistent ``block_names`` will be written to disk as a single
``G3TimesampleMap`` object, which stores co-sampled data as a map containing
multiple G3Vector objects along with a vector of timestamps.
The field-names in the ``data`` block will be the keys in the G3TimesampleMap
and will be the names that show up in Grafana, so it is important that these are
descriptive and unique within each Feed.
In the example above, the keys of the ``G3TimesampleMap`` will be
``field_name_1`` and ``field_name_2``.
The ``block_name`` is only used internally and will not be written
to disk, so it is only important that that the ``block_name`` is unique to this
cosampled block.

Each set of data that a feed publishes that is non-cosampled should be
published to a different ``block_name``.
For instance, for the L372 agent data coming from separate channels are not
co-sampled.
The LS372 temperatures should then look like::

    message = {
        'block_name': 'channel_01',
        'timestamp': <ctime>,
        'data': {
            'channel_01_T': <channel 1 temperature reading>,
            'channel_01_R': <channel 1 resistance reading>
         }
    }

The LS372 G3Frames will then contain a G3TimesampleMap for each channel,
containing the temperature and voltage readings along with their timestamps.

Field Name Requirements
'''''''''''''''''''''''
Field names must:

- Contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Begin with a letter or any number of underscores followed by a letter.
- Be no longer than 255 characters.

Attempting to publish an invalid field name should raise an error by the agent.
However, if invalid field names somehow make it to the aggregator, the
aggregator will attempt to correct them before writing to disk.

Subscribing to a Feed
---------------------

Occasionally you might want your agent or client to receive data directly from
another agent. For instance, the aggregator agent subscribes to all agent feeds to write
their data to hk files, and the pysmurf-controller subscribes to the pysmurf-monitor
feed so that it can put pysmurf data directly into the session-data object.
There are a few different ways for your agent to subscribe to an OCS Feed.
Once the twisted reactor has started, both the ``subscribe_to_feed`` and
``subscribe`` functions can be used.
The ``subscribe_to_feed`` method takes the ``agent_address``, ``feed_name``,
and the callback function. By default, this function protects an agent from
subscribing to a topic multiple times.
The ``subscribe`` function provides more direct access to the Crossbar
subscription method.
It takes in the full topic URI along with an optional dict ``options`` to
specify more detailed subscription options such as pattern matching behavior.
For instance, the following line will subscribe to all OCS feeds in the
``observatory`` namespace::

    agent.subscribe(callback, 'observatory..feeds.', options={'match': 'wildcard'})

Before the reactor has started, the ``subscribe_on_start`` function can be used
to queue up a subscribe call to run as soon as the reactor starts.

Subscribing with a Client
`````````````````````````
It is also possible for client objects to subscribe to feeds...

Examples
````````
Here is an example showing how the ``registry`` agent subscribes its
heartbeat registration callback::

    class RegistryAgent:
        def __init__(self, agent):
            self.agent = agent
            self.agent.subscribe_on_start(
                self._register_heartbeat, 'observatory..feeds.heartbeat',
                options={'match': 'wildcard'}
            )

        def _register_heartbeat(self, _data):
            msg, feed = _data
            self.registered_agents[feed['agent_address']].refresh()
