session.data
============

Data Feeds make use of the crossbar Pub/Sub functionality to pass data around
the network, however, sometimes you might not want to receive all data, just
the most recent values. For this purpose there is the ``session.data`` attribute.
This is a per OCS operation location to store recent data of interest to OCS
Agent users.  The ``session`` argument passed to each Operation function is an
object of class :class:`ocs.ocs_agent.OpSession`.

Often this is used to store the most recent values that are queried by the
Agent, for example the temperature of thermometers on a Lakeshore device. This
information can then be retrieved by a running OCS client and used to inform
operation of the Client, for instance waiting until a certain temperature set
point in your cryostat before starting detector data acquisition.

Agent Access
------------

To understand how to add data to the ``session.data`` object let's look at the
Fake Data Agent as an example, specifically at its primary Process,
``start_acq``:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    def start_acq(self, session, params=None):
        """**Process:**  Acquire data and write to the feed.

        This Process has no useful parameters.

        The most recent fake values are stored in the session.data object in
        the format::

There's a lot going on here, which mostly has to do with generating the random
data that the Agent produces for testing. The part relevant for our discussion
is lines 95-100::

    # Update session.data
    data_cache = {"fields": {}, "last_updated": None}
    for channel, samples in block.data.items():
        data_cache['fields'][channel] = samples[-1]
    data_cache['last_updated'] = block.timestamps[-1]
    session.data.update(data_cache)


This block formats the latest values for each "channel" into a dictionary and
stores it in ``session.data``.


Structure and Content
---------------------

The structure of the ``data`` entry is not strictly defined, but
please observe the following guidelines:

- Document your ``data`` structure in the Operation docstring.
- Provide a `timestamp` with the readings, or with each group of
  readings, so that the consumer can confirm they're recent.
- The session data is passed to clients with every API response, so
  avoid storing a lot of data in there (as a rule of thumb, try to
  keep it < 100 kB).
- Fight the urge to store timestreams (i.e. a history of recent
  readings) -- try to use data feeds for that.
- When data are so useful that they are used by other clients /
  control scripts to make decisions in automated contexts, then they
  should also be pushed out to a data feed, so that there is a full
  record of all variables that were affecting system behavior.


.. note::
    You should consider the desired structure carefully, as future changes the
    data structure may cause existing clients that make use of the ``session.data``
    object to break. Changes that do take place should be announced in the
    change logs of new OCS versions.


There are some restrictions on what data can be carried in
``session.data``:

- The session.data will ultimately be converted and transported using
  JSON, so some containers will be automatically converted into
  JSON-compatible forms.  Specifically note that:

  - dict keys will be converted to strings.
  - there is no distinction between lists and tuples.
  - there is no (standardized) support for non-finite floats such as
    inf, -inf, or NaN.

- If your session.data contains any NaN, they will be converted to
  None (which is transported as JSON null).
- If your session.data contains inf/-inf, or other JSON-encodable
  entities, OCS will raise an error.  To have those transported as
  None/null, you should convert inf/-inf to NaN before storing the
  data in session.data.
- If your session.data includes numpy arrays (or scalars), these will
  be converted to serializable types automatically using
  ``numpy.tolist``.


Client Access
-------------
Once your Agent is storing information in the ``session.data`` object you
likely want to access it via an OCS client. The ``session`` object is returned
by all :ref:`Operation Methods<op_replies>`, for instance the ``status`` method, as shown in this small example::

    from ocs.ocs_client import OCSClient

    therm_client = OCSClient('fake-data1')
    therm_client.acq.start()

    response = therm_client.acq.status()

After running the client we can examine the data dict stored within the response::

    >>> print(response.session.get('data'))
    {'fields': {'channel_00': 0.11220355191080153, 'channel_01':
    0.0850365880364649, 'channel_02': 0.16598799420080332, 'channel_03':
