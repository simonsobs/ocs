Operation Locking
-----------------

Currently our Agent has one Task and one Process. OCS is capable of running the
Task while the Process runs, however, when interacting with hardware you often
want to ensure that only one command is being sent to the hardware at a time.
To make Tasks/Processes exclusively have control over communication with a
hardware device when called we need to add the TimeoutLock.

Adding the simple case of locking out all other Operations during a Task or
Process would look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    def count(self, session, params):
        with self.lock.acquire_timeout(job='count') as acquired:
            if not acquired:
                self.log.warn(f"Could not start Process because "
                              f"{self.lock.job} is already running")
                return False, "Could not acquire lock"

            session.set_status('running')

            # Initialize the counter
            self._count=True
            counter = 0

            self.log.info("Starting the count!")

            # Main process loop
            while self.count:
                counter += 1
                self.log.debug(f"{counter}! Ah! Ah! Ah!")
                session.data = {"value": counter,
                                "timestamp": time.time()}
                time.sleep(1)

        return True, 'Acquisition exited cleanly.'

    @ocs_agent.param('text', default='hello world', type=str)
    def print(self, session, params):
        with self.lock.acquire_timeout(job='print') as acquired:
            if not acquired:
                self.log.warn(f"Could not start Task because"
                              f"{self.lock.job} is already running")
                return False, "Could not acquire lock"

            # Set operations status to 'running'
            session.set_status('running')

            # Log the text provided to the Agent logs
            self.log.info(f"{params['text']}")

            # Store the text provided in session.data
            session.data = {'text': params['text'],
                            'last_updated': time.time()}

        # bool, 'descriptive text message'
        # True if task succeeds, False if not
        return True, 'Printed text to logs'

In this basic form the TimeoutLock will lock out any other Operation during
execution. We can see this if we run the Agent, start the count Process, and
try to run the print Task:

.. code-block::

    2022-07-22T15:54:46-0400 startup-op: launching count
    2022-07-22T15:54:46-0400 start called for count
    2022-07-22T15:54:46-0400 count:0 Status is now "starting".
    2022-07-22T15:54:46-0400 count:0 Status is now "running".
    2022-07-22T15:54:46-0400 Starting the count!
    2022-07-22T15:54:48-0400 start called for print
    2022-07-22T15:54:48-0400 print:1 Status is now "starting".
    2022-07-22T15:54:53-0400 Could not start Task because count is already running
    2022-07-22T15:54:53-0400 print:1 Could not acquire lock
    2022-07-22T15:54:53-0400 print:1 Status is now "done".

This behavior is typically fine for Tasks, but means we need to stop a running
Process before starting a Task. To handle this case the TimeoutLock has the
ability to temporarily release and then reacquire the lock, allowing short
Tasks to run during a Process loop. We will implement this here, but for more
details see :ref:`release_and_reacquire`.

Agent Code

Our Agent in full now looks like this:

                it to False via the count.stop() command. Your Agent won't use this
                exact attribute, but might have a similar one.

Running the Agent

Now if we try to run the print Task while the count Process is running we see
that print runs:

.. code-block::

    2022-07-22T16:09:43-0400 start called for count
    2022-07-22T16:09:43-0400 count:0 Status is now "starting".
    2022-07-22T16:09:43-0400 count:0 Status is now "running".
    2022-07-22T16:09:43-0400 Starting the count!
    2022-07-22T16:09:46-0400 start called for print
    2022-07-22T16:09:46-0400 print:1 Status is now "starting".
    2022-07-22T16:09:46-0400 hello world

    2022-07-22T16:09:46-0400 print:1 Status is now "done".

Next, we will add an OCS Feed and publish the count to it, saving data to disk!
