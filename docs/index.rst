Observatory Control System
==========================

The Observatory Control System is a distributed control system designed to
coordinate data acquisition in astronomical observatories.

This documentation is split into three main sections. First, the User Guide.
This is for users who want to configure and run a system controlled by OCS.
Next, the Agent Reference. This section covers each OCS Agent and how to
configure them. Finally, the Developer Guide. These pages are for those who
want to understand more of what goes on within OCS, and for those looking to
write OCS Agents or Clients.
