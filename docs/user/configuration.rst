Configuration
=============
There are two primary configuration files to consider when setting up OCS.
There is the OCS Site Config File (SCF) and the Docker Compose config file.
These two files define the state of a site's OCS Agents and supporting docker

Understanding these files is important for configuring a working
system. Details about configuring each are discussed in the following pages:
