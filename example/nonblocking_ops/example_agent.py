        TASK (blocking)

        In a blocking implementation of a Task or Process function, we
        may:

        - perform any blocking I/O operations using standard python
          functions, and use time.sleep.

        - request that twisted operations be scheduled to run in the
          reactor thread (for example, add_message will do this
          automatically if it detects it's being called from a worker
          thread).

        We may not:
        - use any twisted facilities, except those specifically
          designated for use in a worker thread (e.g. callFromThread).

        Blocking Operation functions require no special decoration.

        TASK (non-blocking)

        In a non-blocking implementation of a Task or Process
        function, we may:

        - use twisted functions freely, as we are running in the
          reactor thread.
        - make blocking i/o requests by wrapping them in
          deferToThread.

        We may not:

        - cause the function to block or sleep using non-twisted
          methods.
        
        Within twisted, asynchronous routines that perform blocking
        operations (without blocking the reactor thread) will return a
        Deferred object, immediately, instead of the result of the
        request you have made.  To suspend the function until the
        actual result is ready, you should:
        - decorate the function with @inlineCallbacks.
        - use the idiom "x = yield Function(...)" idiom.

        This latter idiom is used on the dsleep function; not because
        we care what the function returned but because we definitely
        want to wait until that function has completed before
        proceeding with the next step in our operation.
